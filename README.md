# Car-Price-Prediction-using-ML
This project focuses on predicting the selling price of cars using machine learning, leveraging features such as the car's age, fuel type, seller type, transmission type, and more. 

The goal is to build an accurate model that estimates car prices, aiding both buyers and sellers in making informed decisions. 
We employed two models—**Linear Regression** for its simplicity and interpretability, and **Random Forest Regressor** for its ability to handle complex, non-linear relationships. 

After preprocessing the data, encoding categorical variables, and scaling features, we trained and evaluated both models using metrics like Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and R² Score. 
The Random Forest Regressor outperformed Linear Regression, demonstrating higher accuracy and better generalization, making it the preferred choice for this prediction task.
